What if I told you that you know nothing at all for certain. What if I told you I could prove it? Look up. Now look down. How did you know where to look when I said look up? Did you know for certain that up is above you or did you know this only because at some point someone told you it was so. In truth everything we know we only know because someone told us it was so. And what if they were wrong?
